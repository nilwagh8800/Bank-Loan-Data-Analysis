# Bank Loan Report Analysis | SQL & Power BI
# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data using SQL for querying insights and Power BI for visualization. It provides key metrics such as total loan applications, funded amounts, repayment trends, loan status distributions, and borrower attributes to help financial institutions assess loan performance and default risks.

# Key Objectives
Analyze loan applications, funded amounts, and repayments.
Identify good vs. bad loans using SQL conditions.
Visualize loan performance metrics using Power BI.
Provide interactive insights using slicers and filters.

# Dataset
Name: bank_loan_data.csv (or from SQL database)
Key Columns: loan_id, issue_date, loan_amount, total_payment, int_rate, dti, loan_status, home_ownership, address_state, term, emp_length, purpose

# Tools & Technologies Used
SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server) – Data extraction and transformation
Power BI – Data modeling, DAX, and dashboard design
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Calculations for insights
Excel/Python (Optional) – Data cleaning

# Key Insights
1 Loan Disbursement Trends: Monthly and yearly funding trends
2 Good vs. Bad Loans: Percentage of fully paid vs. charged-off loans
3 Default Risk Factors: Impact of interest rate, DTI, and employment length
4 State-wise Loan Distribution: Identifies high-loan-volume regions
5 Borrower Behavior Analysis: Purpose-wise and homeownership trends
